🎙️ DeepFake Voice Detection using AI & Machine Learning

🔍 Project Overview
DeepFake Voice Detection is an AI/ML-based system designed to identify whether an audio sample is real or artificially generated. With the rapid growth of voice cloning and text-to-speech technologies, fake audio can be used for fraud, impersonation, and misinformation. This project focuses on detecting synthetic voices by analyzing audio signal patterns that differ from genuine human speech 🤖🔊.

🎯 Aim of the Project
The primary aim of this project is to enhance audio authenticity and security by building a reliable machine learning model that can distinguish real voices from DeepFake voices. It helps reduce risks in areas like banking fraud, digital forensics, cybersecurity, and media verification 🛡️📞.

🧠 How It Works
1️⃣ Audio Input – Users upload a voice sample in audio format 🎧
2️⃣ Feature Extraction – Important audio features such as MFCCs, pitch, energy, and spectral features are extracted using Librosa 📊
3️⃣ Model Training – Machine learning models like Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks are trained to learn patterns of real vs fake voices 🤖
4️⃣ Prediction – The trained model predicts whether the uploaded audio is Real or DeepFake with confidence 🎯
